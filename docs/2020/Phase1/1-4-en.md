## What is Javascript?

A programming language that runs on a web browser.
Currently, it is used not only on Web browsers but also for various purposes.

It has nothing to do with Java.

---

## How do you write it?

Declare reading from an external file or
```
<script type="text/javascript" src = "techAcademy.js"> </script>
```

Can write directly
```
<script type="text/javascript">
~ Processing ~
</script>
```

Often written in the head tag.

---

## Let's write it now
```
<script type="text/javascript">
Alert("Taihenda");
</script>
```

---

## Execution order
```
Run from above

<script type="text/javascript">
Alert("Taihenda");
Alert("Taihenda 2");
</script>
```

---

## Variable
You can hold the value using a container called a variable.

```
<script type="text/javascript">
    let alertMessage = "Variables have been used !!"
    alert("alertMessage");
</script>
```

---
## Reassign to variable

The contents of the variable can be overwritten

```
<script type="text/javascript">
    let alertMessage = "Variables have been used !!"
    alert(alertMessage);

    alertMessage = "You can change the inside of the variable !!"
    alert(alertMessage);
</script>
```

---
## type

Variables can contain various types of data

```
<script type="text/javascript">
    let number = 1;
    alert(number);

    let string = "character";
    alert(string);

    let boolean = true;
    alert(boolean);

    let array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    alert(array [4]);
</script>
```

---
## Calculation

Multiply the formula
```
<script type="text/javascript">
    alert(1+2);
    alert(1-2);
    alert(1*2);
    alert(1/2);

    let num1 = 100;
    let num2 = 200
    alert(num1 + num2);
</script>
```

---

## Conditional branching is possible

```
<script type="text/javascript">
    let temperature = 20;
    if(temperature < 15) {
        alert("cold");
    } else if(temperature < 25) {
        alert("happy!");
    } else {
        alert("hot!!");
    }
</script>
```
---

## loop

Can be iterative

```
<script type="text/javascript">
    for(let i = 0; i <= 4; i ++) {
        alert(i);
    }
</script>
```

---
## Loop 2

How to use iterative processing

```
<script type="text/javascript">
    let temperatures = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
    for(let i = 0; i <= 4; i++) {
        alert(temperatures [i]);
    }
</script>
```
---
## Function

Processing can be standardized.

```
<script type="text/javascript">
    let current Feeling = feel(20);
    alert(current Feeling);

    function feel(temperature) {
        if(temperature < 15) {
            return "cold";
        } else if(temperature < 25) {
            return "happy!";
        } else {
            return "It's hot!!";
        }
    }
</script>
```
---

## Combine processing

```
<script type="text/javascript">
    let temperatures = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
    for(let i = 0; i <= 4; i++) {
        let current Feeling = feel(temperatures [i]);
        alert(current Feeling);
    }

    function feel(temperature) {
        if(temperature < 15) {
            return "cold";
        } else if(temperature < 25) {
            return "just right";
        } else {
            return "It's hot !!";
        }
    }
</script>
```

## Library

A library is a set of Javascript functions.

Various Javascript libraries are open to the public,
Various useful functions are available.

---

## Finally

What Javascript looks like today
I explained only the touch.
For the place to move the screen,
I will start in earnest from the next time.

By writing your own code while leveraging a powerful library
We will add various movements to the screen.

Please look forward to.
