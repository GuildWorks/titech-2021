# 2. Let's define the document structure of the screen with HTML

---

## What is HTML?

Abbreviation for Hyper Text Markup Language.

Of a text document with embedded hyperlinks,
A language for defining structures (headings, paragraphs, etc.).

---

## How do you write it?

### Enclose it in tags to indicate its meaning.
```
<h1> Heading tag </h1>
```

### Tags can also create a hierarchical structure.
```
<main>
    <h1> Heading tag </h1>
</main>
```

### Tags may have attributes as supplementary information.
```
<img src = "path to image file">
```

---

# Let's write now

---

![profile sample](images/profile_sample.png)

---

![profile nostyle](images/profile_nostyle.png)

---

## Create an HTML file

1. From the vscode menu, select File> New File
1. Write an appropriate document
1. Save the file with ctrl + s
    - Create a suitable folder for the folder
    - The file name is "detail.html"
1. Double-click the saved file to open it (opens in the browser)

---

## Create a frame that fits the HTML writing style
```
<! DOCTYPE html>
<html lang = "ja">
    <head>
        <title> Member Profile | Sample Project </title>
    </head>
    <body>
        Member profile
    </body>
</html>
```
- DOCTYPE: Declare HTML
- html: Shows the entire HTML document
- head: Indicates the part that declares the information (header information) of the HTML document itself.
- title: Indicates the title of the HTML document itself.
- body: Shows the body of the HTML document

---

## Add a description of the document itself
```
    <head>
        <title> Member Profile | Sample Project </title>
        <meta charset = "utf-8" />
        <meta name = "description" content = "TOTAL Sample Project" />
    </head>
```

- meta tag: Indicates a description of the document itself
    - Specify name and content to explain
    - Add a description of the sentence itself with description
    - Specify the character code with charset (can be specified directly with the attribute)

---

## Add text

```
    <body>
        Member profile

(￣ ■ ￣;) !?

Even if you put line breaks and spaces as text
It has no meaning as HTML.
Let's use tags to define the structure of the document.
