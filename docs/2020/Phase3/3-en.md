## Review previous sessions
- In the first session, we learned the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
  - [Reference: 1st handout](https://github.com/GuildWorks/titech-2020/blob/master/docs/Phase1)
- In the second session, we learned the basics of Vue.js (Nuxt.js).
  - [Reference: 2nd edition](https://github.com/GuildWorks/titech-2020/blob/master/docs/Phase2)


---
#### Get your development environment ready
- If this is your first time participating in this event, set up an environment to develop on your own PC. The GuildWorks members will support you, so please ask them.
  - [Reference: Environment building](https://github.com/GuildWorks/titech-2020/blob/master/docs/Phase1/1-1.md)
- If you're ready, download the latest code from [remote repository on GitHub] (https://github.com/GuildWorks/titech-2020).
  - Open GitBash(Terminal) in the `titech-2020` directory and run the following command.
    ````
    git pull
    ````
  
---
#### Confirm the app we created
- To recap, let's run the app we created last time to see how it works.
  - Let's run the following command in GitBash (Terminal)
  ```
    # Lines beginning with # are comments and will not be executed

    # If your current location is in the titech-2020 directory, move
    cd titech-nuxt-day2-answer

    # Install the required modules
    npm install

    # Launch the app.
    npm run dev
    ````
  - Then go to http://localhost:3000/.
---
#### Top Screen

http://localhost:3000/

---
#### members list
 ![w:800px](images/3-2.png)
http://localhost:3000/list ...

---

#### member details
 ![w:800px](images/3-3.png)
http://localhost:3000/user/0001

---
#### where I'm concerned.
- The content of the display does not change.
  - Displayed data is [sample](https://github.com/GuildWorks/titech-2020/blob/master/titech-nuxt-day2-answer/mock/userlist.json). 
    - We can't add a user.
    - We can't update our profile.
- Anyone can see the data without logging in.

---
## Overview of what we do today
The functions and screens to be developed are as follows
- User registration

---
- Check the current state of the app that we will be modifying.
  - In GitBash(Terminal) that we used earlier, press [Ctrl]+[C] to stop the app.
  - Let's run the following command.
    ````
    pwd # Check current position
    cd ...   # One level up
    pwd # Again, check the current position.
    cd titech-nuxt-firebase-tutorial # Move to the directory of the application we will modify this time
    npm install # Install the required modules
    npm run dev # Start the app
    ````
  - Then go to http://localhost:3000/.
    - You'll see each pages we modify today.
---
- Let's make it possible to use the backend process of the application, which is necessary for the function we will develop in this article.
  - What we created in the first and second part of this article is the front end (application). It works on the browser side.
  - The backend (the application) runs on the end of the Internet and returns the data you need. It is also called the server side (application).
  - It is often talked about in terms of the contrast between front-end and back-end, or the contrast between client-side and server-side.

---
- In this bootcamp, we won't be developing a backend from scratch, but instead will use a service called Firebase.

---
## What is Firebase?
- Firebase is a mobile and web application backend service from Google that allows developers to focus on developing their applications, without having to create and manage a service to run on the backend.
- No servers or deployments are required, making it easy to use the backend process.
- There are free plans available that do not require registration of payment information, so let's use them.

---
## Get ready to use Firebase!
- Go to the following link.
  - https://console.firebase.google.com/?hl=ja&pli=1
- If you are asked to sign in to your Google account
  - If you already have a Google account, log in.
  - If you don't have a Google account, click the "Create Account" link at the bottom left to create an account.
  
  

---
- If you see a screen like this, you're good to go.
 ![w:800px](images/3-11.png)
- Click on "Create Project


---
- Give your project a name and click "Continue".
  - You can use any name.
 ![w:1100px](images/3-12.png)

---
- Disable Google Analytics and click on "Create Project".
 ![w:1100px](images/3-13.png)

---
- Once you have created your project, click "Continue".
 ![w:1100px](images/3-14.png)

---
- This is the screenshot of the project that was created. We will use this project to develop it.
 ![w:1000px](images/3-15.png)

---
#### Let's set up the initial setup of Firebase in this app we're developing.
- Click on the gear icon in the top left corner of the screen and select "Set up your project".
   ![w:800px](images/3-16.png)

---
- Click on the "</>" icon in the My Apps section at the bottom of the screen to create a web app for your project.
   ![w:800px](images/3-17.png)

---
- Enter a nickname for your app and click "Register App".
  - You can use any nickname.
   ![w:800px](images/3-18.png)

---
- Copy the selection (the line from apiKey to appId).
   ![w:750px](images/3-19.png)

---
- Open Visual Studio Code and paste the copied settings into `/titech-nuxt-firebase-tutorial/plugins/firebase.ts`.
   ![w:600px](images/3-20.png)
- Now you're done with the initial setup of Firebase.

---
## User Registration
- We use Firebase Authentication.
  - It is a service that provides authentication capabilities.
  - It supports various methods of authentication.
    - Email address and password
    - Google Account
    - Facebook account
    - Twitter account
    etc.

---
#### Configuring the Firebase side
- Select "Authentication" in the menu on the left side and click "Get Started".
     ![w:800px](images/3-21.png)

---
- In this case, click on "Email/Password" to use email and password authentication.
   ![w:1000px](images/3-22.png)

---
- Click on the first slider to activate it and click "Save".
  ![w:1000px](images/3-23.png)
- This will allow you to use the email and password authentication feature.

---
#### Editing the program
- Open `/pages/signup.vue`. This is the file of the user registration page.
- It shows the empty contents of the `submit()` function, which is executed when you click the "register" button.
  ````
      function submit() {
        // TODO
      }
  ````
  - In this function, we call the user registration process provided by Firebase Authentication by email address and password to allow users to register.
--- 
- Let's import firebase so that we can handle it in `/pages/signup.vue`.
  ```
  <script lang="ts">
  import { defineComponent, reactive } from 'nuxt-composition-api'
  import PageHeading from '@/components/page-heading.vue'
  import firebase from '@/plugins/firebase.ts' // Add this line
  ```


---
- Please open the following link.
  https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/password-auth#create_a_password-based_account
  - It contains the code to invoke the user registration process by email address and password.
- Click on the "Copy code sample" icon in the upper right corner of the code block to copy it.
   ![w:600px](images/3-24.png)


---
- Paste the copied code into the `submit()` function.
  ````
      const state = reactive({
        email: '',
        password: ''
      })
      function submit() {
        firebase.auth().createUserWithEmailAndPassword(email, password).catch(function(error) {
          // Handle Errors here.
          var errorCode = error.code;
          var errorMessage = error.message;
          // ...
        });
      }
  ````
  - Note: If you have a broken indent after pasting a code, you can add indentation to all selected lines by selecting multiple lines and pressing [Tab]. You can also press [Shift] + [Tab] to delete indentation.

--- 
- Change the argument `email` to `state.email` and `password` to `state.password` of `createUserWithEmailAndPassword()` since it doesn't work as is.
  ````
      const state = reactive({
        email: '',
        password: ''
      })
      function submit() {
        firebase.auth().createUserWithEmailAndPassword(state.email, state.password).catch(function(error) {
          // Handle Errors here.
          var errorCode = error.code;
          var errorMessage = error.message;
          // ...
        });
      }
  ````
- The `email` and `password` entered into the screen is passed to `createUserWithEmailAndPassword()`, and the user registration request including them is executed.

---
- After completing the user registration, you should be taken to the edit profile page.
  ````
      const state = reactive({
        email: '',
        password: ''
      })
      function submit() {
        firebase.auth().createUserWithEmailAndPassword(state.email, state.password)
        .then(() => (location.href = '/profile/edit')) // Add this line with a new line
        .catch(function(error) {
          // Handle Errors here.
          var errorCode = error.code;
          var errorMessage = error.message;
          // ...
        });
      }
  ````

---
- Use the screen to actually register a user.
  - Enter your email address and password and press the register button.
     ![w:1000px](images/3-25.png)

---
- Firebase Authentication verifies that the user has been registered.
     ![w:1100px](images/3-26.png)


---
- Open the developer tools in your browser (in Chrome, right click and select "Verify").
- Select the Network tab from the tab at the top.
   ![w:1000px](images/3-26.5.png)
- Now, let's register again with the same email address as before.

---
- There is an error with the message `EMAIL_EXISTS`.
 ![w:500px](images/3-27.png)
  - This is because the default setting of Firebase Authentication restricts the ability of multiple users to register with the same email address.

---
- If an error occurs, let's make sure we know about it. Please modify the `catch()` as follows.
  ```
          .catch(function(error) {
            // Handle Errors here.
            alert('User registration failed. errorCode: ' + error.code + ', errorMessage:' + error.message)
          });
  ````
- If you get an error, you will get the following pop-up Please try to register as a user again with the same email address.
   ![w:700px](images/3-28.png)

---
## User Authentication
- Again, we'll use Firebase Authentication.
- Let's open `/pages/signin.vue`, which is the login screen file. This is the login screen file.
- The `submit()` function, which is executed when you click the "login" button, is empty.
  ```
      function submit() {
        // TODO
      }
  ````
  - In this function, we need to call the login process with your email address and password to enable the login.
--- 
- Let's import firebase so that we can handle it in `/pages/signin.vue`.
  ```
  <script lang="ts">
  import { defineComponent, reactive } from 'nuxt-composition-api'
  import PageHeading from '@/components/page-heading.vue'
  import firebase from '@/plugins/firebase.ts' // Add this line
  ````

---
- Please open the following link.
  https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/password-auth#sign_in_a_user_with_an_email_address_and_password
  - It contains the code to invoke the login process by email address and password.
- Click on the "Copy code sample" icon in the upper right corner of the code block to copy it.
   ![w:600px](images/3-29.png)


---
- Paste the copied code into the `submit()` function.
  ````
      const state = reactive({
        email: '',
        password: ''
      })
      function submit() {
        firebase.auth().signInWithEmailAndPassword(email, password).catch(function(error) {
          // Handle Errors here.
          var errorCode = error.code;
          var errorMessage = error.message;
          // ...
        });
      }
  ````

---
- Let's change the code as follows
  ````
      const state = reactive({
        email: '',
        password: ''
      })
      function submit() {
        firebase.auth().signInWithEmailAndPassword(state.email, state.password)
        .then(() => (location.href = '/users')) // takes us to the user list after login is complete
        .catch(function(error) {
          // Handle Errors here.
          alert('login failed. errorCode: ' + error.code + ', errorMessage:' + error.message)
        });
      }
  ````
---
  - Changed the argument `email` to `state.email` and `password` to `state.password` of `signInWithEmailAndPassword()`.
  - Changed `email` and `password` to `state.email` and `state.password` to `state.password` when login succeeds.
  - Added an alert on login failure.

---
- Use the screen to actually log in.
  - Enter your email address and password and press the login button.
    - If the user's email address and password are the same as the one you just created, you will be taken to the user list screen.
    - If the email address is different from the user's email address, an `auth/user-not-found` error will occur.
    - If the email address is the same as the user we just created and the password is different, the `auth/wrong-password` error will occur.

---
#### Access control by sign-in status
- Let's control whether or not to display each screen according to the login status.
- We'll use the middleware mechanism in Nuxt.js to determine the login status.
  https://ja.nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/directory-structure/middleware/ ...
  - In the middleware section, describe what you want to do before the screen is drawn.

---
- Open `/middleware/Auth.js`.
  - Open `/middleware/Auth.js`, which has no processing written in it yet.
  ```
  export default function () {
  
  }
  ````

---
- Let's change `/middleware/Auth.js` as follows.
```
import firebase from '@/plugins/firebase.ts'
export const skipAuthPaths = ['/signin', '/signup']

export default function ({ redirect, route, store }) {
  firebase.auth().onAuthStateChanged(function (user) {
    if (user) {
      // User is signed in.
      store.commit('signedIn', true);
    } else { { // User is signed in.
      // No user is signed in. store.commit('signedIn', false;)
      store.commit('signedIn', false);
      if (!skipAuthPaths.includes(route.path)) {
        redirect('/signin')
      }
    }
  })
}
````

---
- The `firebase.auth().onAuthStateChanged()` fetches the currently logged in user, and then branches off the rest of the process depending on whether the user is retrieved (= logged in or not).
  https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/manage-users#get_the_currently_signed-in_user ...
- Store.commit()` stores the login state into the container named "store" to manage the state of the application.
  - We'll implement store later.
- If a user wants to show a screen for authentication without login, the function redirects the user to the login screen with `redirect('/signin')`.

---
- Open `/store/index.ts` and change it to look like this.
  ````
  interface State {
    signedIn: boolean
  }
    
  export const state = () : State => ({
    signedIn: false
  })

  export const mutations = {
    signedIn(state: State, signedIn: boolean) {
      state.signedIn = signedIn
    }
  }
  ````
  - The `store.commit('signedIn', true)` described in `/middleware/Auth.js` allows you to save the login status.

---

- Add a line to your `/layouts/default.vue` to run the `middleware/Auth.js` before the default layout is drawn.
```
<script lang='ts'>
import { defineComponent } from 'nuxt-composition-api'
export default defineComponent({
  middleware: ['Auth'], // Add this line and load Auth.js
  setup(_, { root: { $store } }) {
  }
})
</script>
````

---
- Open your browser in a secret window.
   ![w:800px](images/3-30.png)
  - If you don't, your browser will remember that you have just logged in, so this will reopen the screen as it was before you logged in.

---
- Check the following in your secret window.
  - That when you go to http://localhost:3000 (top), you will be redirected to the login screen.
  - That you will be redirected to the login screen when you try to transition to the member list or your profile.
  - When you log in, you should be able to go to the top, the member list, and your profile.

---
#### Menu display control
- Open `/layouts/default.vue`.
- Nuxt.js makes sure that the content in this file is reflected in each page as the default layout.
  https://ja.nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/concepts/views/#default-layout

---
- Let's change the menu to be displayed according to the login status.
- Let's modify `setup()` as follows.
  ````
    setup(_, { root: { $store } }) {
      const isSignedIn = (): boolean => {
        return $store.state.signedIn
      }    
      return {
        isSignedIn
      }
    }
  ````
  - You can determine the login status from `isSignedIn`.
- Follow the code on the next page and add a branch to determine the login status by `v-if` in the `<template>` tag.

---
````
          <a
            v-if="isSignedIn()"
            href="/users"
            class="text-blue-900 hover:text-blue-600 py-3 px-6 text-sm font-bold"
          >
            Member List
          </a>
          <a
            v-if="isSignedIn()"
            href="/profile"
            class="text-blue-900 hover:text-blue-600 py-3 px-6 text-sm font-bold"
          >
            Your Profile
          </a>
          <a
            href="/signup"
            class="text-blue-900 hover:text-blue-600 py-3 px-6 text-sm font-bold"
          >
            user registration
          </a>
          <a
            v-if="!isSignedIn()"
            href="/signin"
            class="text-blue-900 hover:text-blue-600 py-3 px-6 text-sm font-bold"
          >
            login
          </a>
          <a
            v-if="isSignedIn()"
            href="#"
            class="text-blue-900 hover:text-blue-600 py-3 px-6 text-sm font-bold"
          >
            logout
          </a>
````
---
#### Log out
- Change the `<script>` in `/layouts/default.vue` as follows. The changes are as follows.
  - importing firebase.
  - Add `signOut` in `setup()` and return it to call it from `template`.
  - In `firebase.auth().signOut()`, the logout process is executed.
    https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/password-auth#next_steps

---
````
import { defineComponent } from 'nuxt-composition-api'
import firebase from '@/plugins/firebase.ts'
export default defineComponent({
  middleware: ['Auth'],
  setup(_, { root: { $store } }) {
    const isSignedIn = (): boolean => {
      return $store.state.signedIn
    }    
    const signOut = (): void => {
      firebase.auth().signOut()
    }
    return {
      isSignedIn,
      signOut
    }
  }
})
````

---
- Let's add an `@click="signOut"` to the `<a>` tag of the logout.
  ````
            <a
              v-if="isSignedIn()"
              href="#"
              @click="signOut"
              class="text-blue-900 hover:text-blue-600 py-3 px-6 text-sm font-bold"
            >
              logout
            </a>
  ````
  - Click Logout to start the logout process.

---
- Make sure that the menu changes as follows
  - When you are logged in.
     ![w:1100px](images/3-6.png)
  - When I logged out.
     ![w:1100px](images/3-6.5.png)

---
## Database integration.
- Use Cloud Firestore.
  https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore
  - It provides a database for storing data and the basic operations for handling data.
  - Data is stored in a hierarchical structure.

---
- Data Storage Image
 ![w:1100px](images/3-31.png)

---
#### Configuring the Firebase side
- Select "Cloud Firestore" in the menu on the left side and click on "Create Database".
     ![w:1100px](images/3-32.png)

---
- Select "Start in Test Mode" and click "Next".
   ![w:800px](images/3-33.png)

---
- Select "asia-northeast1" (Tokyo) and click "Enable".
   ![w:800px](images/3-34.png)
  https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/locations#location-r

---
- The database is ready to go.
   ![w:900px](images/3-35.png)

---
#### Edit your profile (except for the icon image)
- Create a profile editor to register your own profile.
- Go to http://localhost:3000/profile/edit.
- Open `/pages/profile/edit.vue`, which is your profile's editing file. This is the file for your profile's edit screen.

---
- First, let's import the firebase.
  ```
  import firebase from '@/plugins/firebase.ts'
  ````
- The next step is to get your user ID, which is needed to register your profile.
---
- Remove the comment `// TODO: get user ID, email address` and paste the following code into it.
  ```
      firebase.auth().onAuthStateChanged(function (user) {
        if (user) {
          // User is signed in.
          userData.id = user.uid
          userData.email = user.email
          getUserData(user)
        } else { }
          // No user is signed in.
        }
      })
  ````
  - The same `onAuthStateChanged()` as used in `/middleware/Auth.js` is used to get the user ID and email address and set them where needed.

---
- Change the `setProfile` as follows.
  ````
      const setProfile = (): void => {
        const data = {
          name: userData.name,
          email: userData.email,
          role: userData.role,
          iconUrl: userData.iconUrl,
          comment: userData.comment,
          profile: userData.profile,
        }
        firebase
          .firestore()
          .collection('users') // The users collection, in
          .doc(userData.id) // In a document called <user ID>.
          .set(data) // Set the data
          .then(()) => {
            window.location.href = '/profile' // After completion, the user is taken to the profile screen
          })
      }
  ````
---
- You can actually fill out your profile and press the "Register" button.
   ![w:900px](images/3-36.png)

---
- Make sure your data is registered in Cloud Firestore. 
   ![w:1100px](images/3-37.png)

---
- Let's show the registered data on the profile edit screen.
  - Change the `getUserData` as follows.

---
````
    const getUserData = (user) => {
      firebase
        .firestore()
        .collection('users') // From the users collection, the
        .doc(user.uid) // The document with the specified uid is
        .get() // Get
        .then((doc) => {
          if (doc.exists) {
            userData.name = doc.data().name
            userData.role = doc.data().role
            userData.iconUrl = doc.data().iconUrl
            userData.profile = doc.data().profile
            userData.comment = doc.data().comment
          }
        })
        .catch((err) => {
          console.log('Error getting user document', err);
        })
    }
````
---
- When you go to the Edit Profile screen, you will see the data you have already registered.
   ![w:900px](images/3-36.png)

---
#### Display data on your profile screen
- Likewise, your profile page (http://localhost:3000/profile) should display the data you've already registered.
- The file for your profile page is `/pages/profile/index.vue`.
- You can modify the code on your own based on what you did in the profile edit screen.

---
- Answer is here.
  https://github.com/GuildWorks/titech-2020/blob/master/titech-nuxt-firebase-day3-answer/pages/profile/index.vue

---
#### Member list
- Let's make the member list page (http://localhost:3000/users) also show the registered data.
- The page file of the member list is `/pages/users/index.vue`.

---
- Import firebase.
  ```
  import firebase from '@/plugins/firebase.ts'
  ````
- Please modify `setup()` as follows.

---
````
  setup(_) {
    const userList = reactive<User[]>([])
    firebase
      .firestore()
      .collection('users') // From the users collection, the
      .get() // Get all the documents
      .then(function (querySnapshot) {
        querySnapshot.forEach(function (doc) { // For each element of the fetched document array
          userList.push({ // take the value of each field and add it to the userList array as an object
            id: doc.id,
            name: doc.data().name,
            email: doc.data().email,
            role: doc.data().role,
            iconUrl: doc.data().iconUrl,
            comment: doc.data().comment,
            profile: doc.data().profile,
          })
        })
      })    
    const userLink = (userId: string): void => {
      window.location.href = '/users/' + userId
    }
    return {
      userList,
      userLink,
    }
  },
````

---
- Make sure you see the users you have registered.
   ![w:1100px](images/3-38.png)

---
- Add users to see what it looks like if you have more than one user.
  - Log out and register a user with a different email address.
    - We don't check the existence of the email address, so you can register a user with an random email address.
    - However, it is preferable to use your own email address if possible because the email will be sent when you modify the app and add the email sending function in the future.

---
Reference
- Gmail's alias feature makes it convenient to use multiple email addresses in one email address.
  - If you have a `imahashi@gmail.com` account, you can add `+` and any alphanumeric characters before `@`, such as `imahashi+2@gmail.com` or `imahashi+third@gmail.com`, and mail will be sent to the same address. 

---
- We can confirm that the added users are also shown.
   ![w:1100px](images/3-39.png)

---
#### Member profile
- Make sure that the registered data is also displayed on the member profile screen.
  - The user ID is required in the `_id` part of the path (http://localhost:3000/users/_id), so you need to display it from the user list screen.
- The file for the member profile screen is `/pages/users/_id.vue`.

---
- Import firebase.
  ```
  import firebase from '@/plugins/firebase.ts'
  ````
- Please modify `setup()` as follows.

---
````
  setup(_, { root }: SetupContext) {
    const userData = reactive<User>({
      id: '',
      name: '',
      email: '',
      role: '',
      iconUrl: '',
      comment: ''',
      profile: {
        belongs: ''',
        nickname: '',
        birthplace: '',
        birthday: '',
        bloodType: '',
        sign: '',
        hobby: '',
      },
    })
    firebase
      .firestore()
      .collection('users')
      .doc(root.$route.params.id) // Get the ID from the URL and get the document for that ID
      .get()
      .then((doc) => {
        if (doc.exists) {
          userData.id = root.$route.params.id
          userData.name = doc.data().name
          userData.email = doc.data().email
          userData.role = doc.data().role
          userData.iconUrl = doc.data().iconUrl
          userData.profile = doc.data().profile
          userData.comment = doc.data().comment
        }
      })
      .catch((err) => {
        console.log('Error getting document', err)
      })
    return {
      userData,
    }
  },
````

---
- You can confirm that your member profile will be displayed.
   ![w:1000px](images/3-40.png)

---
## Extra.
- Make sure you can upload your photos in your profile edit screen.
- Use Cloud Storage for Firebase.
  https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage
  - This service saves files such as photos and videos.
- Open `/pages/profile/edit.vue`.

---
- It is already possible to drag and drop an image on the icon part.
- Let's change the `setIcon` as follows.

---
````
    const setIcon = (file: File): void => {
      const storageRef = firebase.storage().ref() 
      // Get a reference to the profile image upload location
      const fileRef = storageRef.child(
        'images/profile/' + userData.id + '/' + file.name
      )
      // Upload your profile image to storage
      fileRef.put(file).then(function (snapshot) {
        // Update the URL of the user data
        snapshot.ref.getDownloadURL().then((url) => {
          userData.iconUrl = url
        })
      })
    }
````

---  
- After dragging and dropping the image, press the "Register" button to set the icon.
   ![w:900px](images/3-41.png)

---  
- When you open Cloud Storage, you can see that the images are stored.
   ![w:1100px](images/3-42.png)

## Summary
:white_check_mark: This time you can now use Firebase to register users, login, register/read/update data, etc.

:white_check_mark: The complete app is in the `titech-nuxt-firebase-day3-answer` directory. If you missed something, please check here.

:white_check_mark: If you understand the first three articles, you should be able to develop a simple app like this one.

If you're interested, feel free to customize your app or create your own!
